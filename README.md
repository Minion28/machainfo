# machainfo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application that uses web scraping to get information from the [Machakos website](https://machakos.go.ke).
The [application](https://github.com/Minion28/machainfo/blob/master/machainfo_V1.0.0.apk) only gets the title of the event the governor was involved in and the picture. Other features include:
- A bottom navigation bar that has all the pages carrying the events.
- A splash screen where there is a picture of the honorable governor [Wavinya Ndeti](https://twitter.com/Wavinya_Ndeti) in the background and the [county logo](https://twitter.com/Machakos_Gov/photo) at the center as well.<img src="https://github.com/Minion28/machainfo/blob/master/lib/assets/sample%20images/Screenshot_20230512-141108.png">
- When the application is open, you are able to see the visible pages with the events.<img src="https://github.com/Minion28/machainfo/blob/master/lib/assets/sample%20images/Screenshot_20230512-141035.png">
- The [county logo](https://twitter.com/Machakos_Gov/photo) which redirects you to the initial website.<img src="https://github.com/Minion28/machainfo/blob/master/lib/assets/sample%20images/Screenshot_20230512-141058.png">
- An enddrawer that has my information on how to reach me.<img src="https://github.com/Minion28/machainfo/blob/master/lib/assets/sample%20images/Screenshot_20230512-141044.png">
